title: Identity Crisis: Finding and Hiring Creatives with Lara not Laura
---

I hung out with designer/developer I admire,[Lara Schenck](http://notlaura.com), who works for herself, largely in education.  She teaches a course at Pratt Institute on UI Prototyping and Code while working indepdently as an educator and developer.  

We got to talking about titles, after I had recently read an [article I found through Designer News, Identity Crisis: Designer Job Titles by Diogenes Brito](https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/identity-crisis-designer-job-titles-1ae086c796de).  Some wildly ineffective ad came on the tv, and I told her that I believed ads suffer because of job titles.  When a company or product is looking for a creative to design an ad campaign, they probably go with a few job titles, "job title x", "job title y", that they are familiar with, and regardless of their search method, the recruiters rely on those titles to get results.  The right person for the job might not consider themselves a "job title x" but rather "title of job x" or "job title z". There's just something so dysfunctional about the majority of tv advertisements that makes me think these recruiters/products/companies could be looking in all the wrong places for their talent.

Lara pointed out that I wasn't rambling and that this was probably an enormous hurdle in hiring creatives of any kind, especially in the world of web design and development.  The semiotics are getting in the way when treading unpaved ground!  Diogenes Brito's article focuses on the accuracy of a job title for the purpose of the individual, but what about the accuracy of a job title for the purpose of the product?
