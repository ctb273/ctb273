title: Jonathan Ive on Design Education

"We may seem a little testy when things we have been working on for eight years are copied in six months – but it wasn't inevitable that it was going to work."

"It's not copying, it's theft. They stole our time, time we could have had with our families. I actually feel quite strongly about it. It's funny – I was talking to somebody and they said do you think when somebody copies what you do it's flattering? No."

Ive said that to create something new, designers had to "reject reason" and accept when a project wasn't working and stop working on it, even if significant money has already been invested.

Most designers are too quick to give in to pressures from marketing departments and corporations, but Apple's products have a more uniform aesthetic because there is no reason to change them, he added.

"To do something new and truly innovative, does require you reject reason. And the problem is when you do that, the behaviours, what that looks like, can make you look a bit odd."
